### Object Detection Using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

#### Technologies Used
1. Python
2. YOLOv8
3. OpenCV

#### Techniques
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This project involved detecting objects in real-time using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and the OpenCV library for image processing. The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset to enhance accuracy for specific object classes.

#### Learning Outcomes
1. Gained in-depth knowledge of the YOLO architecture.
2. Learned how to fine-tune pre-trained models for specific tasks.
3. Developed an understanding of real-time object detection and tracking using OpenCV.

#### Results
1. Achieved mAP (mean Average Precision) of 0.75 at IoU=0.5
2. Real-time inference speed: 30 FPS (frames per second)
